# History of UX.

The termn UX was first coined in 1990 by cognitive psychologist [Dan Norman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Norman).

The termn is relatively new but the principles of user experience actually stretch back thousands of years, all the way to ancient China, where the practice of Feng [Shui began](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feng_shui).
Practitioners believe that the arrangement of a physical space, like how furniture is positioned in a room, could bring someone luck or improve their health and happiness.

**In the tech world, user experience mostly focuses on how people use or interact with products.**

# User Experience

How a person, the user, feels about interacting with, or experiencing, a product.

## To have a good experience the product needs to be

- Usable
- Equitable
- Enjoyable
- Useful

Being **equitable** means your designs are useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities and backgrounds.
Considering the unique needs of many different people is important work and thinking about equitable design is key.

User experience is also about making things **enjoyable** to use, which creates a positive connection between the user and the product.

As humans, we want products that are **useful**, meaning they solve our problems.
